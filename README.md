# Hypothesis-Testing

Hypothesis testing is used to confirm your conclusion (or hypothesis) about the population parameter (which you know from EDA or your intuition). Through hypothesis testing, we can determine whether there is enough evidence to conclude if the hypothesis about the population parameter is true or not.

When evaluating a hypothesis, we need to account for both the variability in your sample and how large your sample is. 


Hypothesis testing is an essential procedure in statistics. A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is best supported by the sample data. When we say that a finding is statistically significant, it's thanks to a hypothesis test.


**What are the six steps of hypothesis testing?**


**Step 1:** Specify the Null Hypothesis. 

**Step 2:** Specify the Alternative Hypothesis.

**Step 3:** Set the Significance Level 

**Step 4:** Calculate the Test Statistic and Corresponding P-Value.

**Step 5:** Drawing a Conclusion.


**THE ROLE OF HYPOTHESIS TESTS**

We’ve placed our sample mean in the context of all possible sample means while assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Are these results statistically significant?

As you can see, there is no magic place on the distribution curve to make this determination. Instead, we have a continual decrease in the probability of obtaining sample means that are further from the null hypothesis value. Where do we draw the line?

This is where hypothesis tests are useful. A hypothesis test allows us quantify the probability that our sample mean is unusual.

For this series of posts, I’ll continue to use this graphical framework and add in the significance level, P value, and confidence interval to show how hypothesis tests work and what statistical significance really means.


**Part Two:** Significance Levels (alpha) and P values
**Part Three:** Confidence Intervals and Confidence Levels
