# Hypothesis-Testing

Hypothesis testing is used to confirm your conclusion (or hypothesis) about the population parameter (which you know from EDA or your intuition). Through hypothesis testing, we can determine whether there is enough evidence to conclude if the hypothesis about the population parameter is true or not.

When evaluating a hypothesis, we need to account for both the variability in your sample and how large your sample is.

**Step 1:** Specify the Null Hypothesis. ...
